Authors: Pedro Henrique Koeler Goulart and Varun Sreenivasan
Current Version: 1.0


Description:
	- This program takes inspiration from the "ps" command in linux and 
          lists OS processes that belong to the current user. This program can 
          show the process id (pid), process state information, user time, 
          system time, amount of virtual memory, and command line that started 
          the process.


Known issues:
	- No known issues for this version.


How to use:
	- This section describes the development and use for 537ps.
	1. Set up
		- Copy files contained in 537ps.zip into desired directory.
		- Use the "make" command to assemble the program.
	2. Development
		- Use the options.c file to add/remove/edit output of the program.
		- Create new files if other processes information is needed.
	3. Use
		- Initialize the program by using the "537ps" command followed by 
                  display options (below).
		- Possible display options include:
			-p <pid> # Process ID (if no -p provided, lists all processes)
			-s # Process state information
			-U # User time (enabled by default)
			-S # System time
			-v # Amount of virtual memory
			-c # Command-line that started process (enabled by default) 
		- Writing -n, where n is one of the characters above, on the 
                  program enables a display option (lists process information), 
                  while writing -n-, where n is one of the characters above, disables 
                  a display option.
                - If there is repeated input (like -n and -n- for example), the 
                  program will take the last one (-n- in the case above). 

Layout:
	1. Files
		- Makefile # Assembles program
		- options.c # Controls input/output of the program and calls methods.
		- processList.c # Counts and stores information on number of processes that belong to user.
		- processList.h # Header file for processList
		- stats.c # Retrieves information from proc/<pid>/ folder according to option chosen.
		- stats.h # Header file for stats
