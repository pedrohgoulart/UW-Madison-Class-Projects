This is an instruction file for the malloc537, free537, realloc537, and memcheck537
functions.

Authors: Pedro Henrique Koeler Goulart and Varun Sreenivasan
Current Version: 1.0

Description:
	- These functions are similar to malloc, free, and realloc, but they 
	  perform safety checks. These functions can be called just like you normally
	  would call malloc, free, and realloc. 
	- Memcheck537 checks if the memory currently allocated/freed matches data kept
	  by malloc537, free537, and realloc537 functions.

Known issues:
	- No known issues for this version.

How to use:
	- This section describes the development and use for the functions.
	1. Set up
		- Copy files contained in malloc537.zip into desired directory.
		- Combine the makefile of your program with the provided makefile.
		- Include #include "537malloc.h" on your program files.
	2. Development
		- Use the 537malloc.c file to add more functions or edit current
		  functions. You can also use range_tree.c to edit the behavior of
		  the tree (data structure responsible for keeping information on
		  allocated and freed memory). 
	3. Use
		- Call malloc537, free537, realloc537, or memcheck537 respecting the 
		  header file 537malloc.h specifications.

Observations:
	- You can not free a NULL pointer to memory.
	- A warning will be displayed if you attempt to allocate/reallocate a memory of
	  size 0.
